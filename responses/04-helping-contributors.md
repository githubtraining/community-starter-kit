## Understanding contributors

Most contributors take a gradual path to getting involved in an open source community. It usually looks something like this: 

1. Reporting a bug
1. Suggesting a new feature
1. Creating a pull request

More seasoned open source contributors might go straight to creating their first pull request, so adding helpful templates to a repository that makes it easier for _everyone_ to get involved, regardless of their previous experience. 

## Step 6: Adding an issue template

When you add an issue template and pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents when they open a new issue or pull request. Templates help you standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open issues.

### Creating multiple templates

In open source projects, templates make it easy for new contributors to create bug reports, suggest new features, or contribute changes. Mona has already created an issue template for new, can you put one together for bugs?

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding an issue template

1. Access the [**Code**](https://github.com/{{ user.username }}/community-starter-kit/) tab of your project
1. Be sure to select the `add-issue-template` branch from the branch dropdown
1. Click the **Create new file** button
1. Create a file in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder named `bug_report.md` (you can do this by typing `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` in the file name field)
1. Include the issue template header at the top of the file:
     ```
     ---
     name: template name
     about: template description
     ---
     ```

1. Add headings and placeholders for the information you want to collect when a user creates a bug report below the template header you just added
1. After editing the template file, scroll down and click the **Commit new file**
